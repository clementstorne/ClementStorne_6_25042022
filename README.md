# OpenClassrooms - Parcours DÃ©veloppeur Web - Projet 6

## Backend

### Backend Prerequisites

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Back end Installation

Clone this repo. From the "backend" folder of the project, run `npm install`. You
can then run the server with `node server`.
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.

### Dotenv

You will need to create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder.
That file will include 3 variables :
`JWT_SECRET_TOKEN=cIkqM0vFNsk8m75o`
`DB_USERNAME=mentor`
`DB_PASSWORD=soutenance`
